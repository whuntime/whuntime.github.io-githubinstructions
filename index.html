    <h3>Project Assumptions and scope statement</h3>
    <p>This instruction assumes that the "new programmer" knows their trade-craft well enough to instantiate their concept with html, css, & JavaScript. Further, it assumes<br> 
        that they don't have a GitHub account and that they need step by step instruction on how to accomplish their goals.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Note: You will need a basic html page along with any referenced resources images, music, videos, etc. This part is dependent on site requirements.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>GitHub account creation</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Navigate to www.github.com, click Sign up in the upper right corner of the page</p>

    <br>
    <p>Then enter a password and click continue</p>
    <br> <img src="3.png"/>
    <br>
    <p>Once signed and on your home page select the down arrow next to the + icon on the upper right of the screen or your user icon then select new repository. After you have<br>
         created the repository you will access your existing repositories from the user drop-down and selecting Your repositories</p>

    <br>
    <p>On the Create a new repository page you will name your repository. It should be a name that logically matches the purpose of the site you are creating. Note that Public is<br>
         the default setting for repositories so this will not need to be changed for this project. Further, no optional selections will be made. Click Create repository</p>

    <br>
    <p>Navigate to your repositories, click on the new repository you created</p>

    <p>From your computer navigate to the files you have prepared for project upload and drag those files to the window or select the choose your files link on the page navigate to<br>
         the files and select them for upload</p>
